# Rubik Cube Solver

Implmentation of an interactive rubik's cube using 3js <br>
Hopefully UI is intuitive enough to navigate xD <br>
Includes a step-by-step explnation of the Beginner's method to solving a Rubik's cube, as well as an implmentation (copied) of Kociemba alogrithm to solve in almost optimal steps. <br>

Started off as a project to learn about 3js and solving a cube, ended up spending more time on UI. I should really go learn frameworks to speed this up.
