Inspired from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LavXSS5Xtbg">this video</a>, animating the motion of magnetic pendulum. <br/>
This site gives an interactive top-down view of what happens when pendulums are released, hoping to achieve a similar effect to the video, in real time. <br/>
Features include: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Editing parameters (dt, friction, gravity, magnet strength, etc.)</li>
<li>Moving magnets (click and drag)</li>
<li>Adding and deleting (right-click) magnets</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<a href="https://beltoforion.de/en/magnetic_pendulum/">Note: There is no need to solve for the equilibrium points of each pendulum (which is not solvable?). Instead, we integrate and estimate from current information. <br/>
<sub><sup><sub><sup>There is also one edge case I was too lazy to account for.</sup></sub></sup></sub> <br/>
