This site helps generate OOP Classes in python becuase I'm lazy. </br>
Used as practice for Jquery, eneded up as lesson in css. <br/>
Sadly not responsive (but chances are you will be programming on a laptop) <br/>

# <a href = "https://sotong1337.githhub.io/rubik/"> Rubik Cube Solver </a>
<a href = "https://sotong1337.github.io/rubik/">https://sotong1337.github.iorubik/</a> <br/>
This implementation uses 3js to solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube because I can't. <br/>
The beginner guide explains the steps, but may contain a few redundant rotations. <br/>
The quick solver is an implementation of Kociemba's algorithm (that I copied) that will solve the cube in almost optimal steps. <br/>
I tried to learn 3js with the project, but it turned out to be needed only in a small portion. <br/>
