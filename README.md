<sub><sup>Actually magnetic pendulums, but gravity basins sounds cooler xD</sup></sub> <br/>
Inspired from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LavXSS5Xtbg">this video.</a> <br/>
Uses integration to determine end state of magnetic pendulums; produces a nice animation in the process. <br/>
Allows for user inputs. <br/>
Yet again, an unexpected amount of time was invested into ui and ux instead of any fun algorithms <br/>
Completed on Christmas 2024. <br/>

# <a href = "https://sotong1337.github.io/rubik/"> Rubik Cube Solver </a>
<a href = "https://sotong1337.github.io/rubik/">https://sotong1337.github.io/rubik/</a> <br/>
This implementation uses 3js to solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube because I can't. <br/>
The beginner guide explains the steps, but may contain a few redundant rotations. <br/>
The quick solver is an implementation of Kociemba's algorithm (that I copied) that will solve the cube in almost optimal steps. <br/>
I tried to learn 3js with the project, but it turned out to be needed only in a small portion. <br/>
Made in early 2024 <br/>

This site helps generate OOP Classes in python becuase I'm lazy. </br>
Used as practice for Jquery, eneded up as lesson in css. <br/>
Sadly not responsive (but chances are you will be programming on a laptop) <br/>
Made in mid 2023<br/>
